This is a template python project; it contains a basic setup.py,
.gitignore, and other boilerplate common to all/almost all python
packages. Feel free to clone it and edit to start your project. I'm
releasing it to the public domain (CC0). You don't even have to credit
me if you don't want -- feel free to `git commit --amend` on your first
commit if you don't want this in the history for some reason. The
legalese is in `COPYING`.
